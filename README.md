# CryptidHunter

Welcome to my Server Side capstone for Cohort 49 of the Nashville Software School: Cryptid Hunter

The US government and Military leadership has admitted in 2021 that unmanned arial vehicals, often reffered to as unidentified flying objects, are real. 
This leans heavily in the support of the existance of unknown intelligent forces. However, we lack information on what else is exist that has not been confirmed. 
We need to track and report these findings, create a resource for people to create logs of their encounters with all cryptozoological creatures, update repeat encounters, and remove false identifications, all with a circle of committed identifiers.


This application if open for use to anyone with a thirst for the truth, the curious, skeptical, and woke among us. Typically, users will identify as ages 16-30, male, and single.

The basic structure of this application will revolve around a form. Users will fill in a form for their sighting of a creature, publish their post, comment on other users' post, edit personal post, and delete personal post.

This will be an MVC Webapp using C# and Net Core 3.5, with SQL for the server interactions. I am using Github for version control and project tickets. I will be using Firebase from Google for authentication. Any user can log in with a email and a password or with email: a@a.com and password: 123456
